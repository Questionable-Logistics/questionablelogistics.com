				{'Preamble'}
			</h3>

			<p>{'This Charter, for Questionable Logistics Consolidated, forthwith referred to as The Organization or QLC, as ratified on the 24th of June of the year 2952 hereby establishes the rules and regulations within the code of conduct of The Organization as determined by the founders.'}</p>

			<p>{'Note: Much of this document is written in-universe, meaning that this document itself is a part of the experience contained within Star Citizen. However, portions of this document also outline requirements for membership for you, the player of the game rather than the character you are in the game. These requirements will apply in the real world as part of the real world counterpart to the QLC. These portions will be denoted by “[OORP]” standing for “Out Of Role Play”. Clauses that apply across both the real world community, and the in-verse community will be denoted by “[+OORP]” and will apply from the marker to the end of the semantic statement.'}</p>

			<h3 id={'conduct-and-guiding-principles'}>
				{'Conduct and Guiding Principles'}
			</h3>

			<p>{'Upon acceptance, Members of QLC are under oath to follow the code of conduct and guiding principles as laid forth.'}</p>

			<h4 id={'guiding-principles'}>
				{'Guiding Principles'}
			</h4>

			<p>{'Questionable Logistics Consolidated was formed to be a premiere service organization. We engage in military operations but do not identify as a PMC because our scope is much broader. At the end of the day, most people in the known Universe are interested in peace and progress. They are interested in finding meaning out in the verse and pursuing greatness. This carries many different meanings for many different individuals but what sets QLC apart is the fact that we can probably help them get it done.'}</p>

			<p>{'Dually, QLC operates as a humanitarian organization, providing support and aid to those in need and always operates in the interest of peace and life. This extends beyond boundaries such as race or creed – unlike certain organizations throughout the galaxy, being human is not one of our requirements, and not a requirement for QLC to render its services to you. This spirit of diversity and inclusion is woven into the very fabric of QLC, and though we find ourselves sometimes in questionable circumstances or strange contracts, we step lively into a brave tomorrow.'}</p>

			<p>{'[+OORP] Have fun and keep it fun for others. Don\'t ruin this great thing that people have going on. As a member of this community you are granted a great deal of trust, and it is on you to never betray that.'}</p>

			<h4 id={'code-of-conduct'}>
				{'Code of Conduct'}
			</h4>

			<h5 id={'mandate-of-behavior'}>
				{'Mandate of Behavior'}
			</h5>

			<p>{'Members are expected to act honorably, with respect, and professionalism where warranted at all times in all interactions.'}</p>

			<p>{'[+OORP] Members of QLC are required to treat all sentient beings in line with 1.2.1, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, pregnancy status, veteran status, political affiliation, marital status, body size, age, race, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, language, religion or lack thereof, or other identity marker.'}</p>

			<h5 id={'mandate-of-honor'}>
				{'[+OORP] Mandate of Honor'}
			</h5>

			<p>{'Members of QLC will not commit any of the following minor or major infractions. In the event that a member is accused, they will be tried by a jury of their peers of no less than 5 members and will be judged accordingly. The maximum sentence for a minor infraction is 6 months of suspension from all QLC affiliation, activities, resources, and events, and a demotion to the lowest rank within The Organization at the time of the verdict. The maximum sentence for a major infraction is permanent expulsion from The Organization [+OORP] with reports submitted to Cloud Imperium Games. Please note that these are maximum sentences, and there are lesser gradations of these which are to be determined by the jury although final say in any matters will be with the Founders.'}</p>

			<p>{'Minor infractions are outlined as follows:'}</p>

			<ul>
				<li>{'EXCESSIVE USE OF INSULTING LANGUAGE DIRECTED TOWARDS AN INDIVIDUAL OR A GROUP OF PEOPLE SUCH THAT IT CONSTITUTES IDENTIFIABLE HATE'}</li>

			</ul>

			<h4 id={'mandate-of-reality'}>
				{'[OORP] Mandate of Reality'}
			</h4>

			<p>{'Members are expected to remember that Star Citizen is a game. Any behavior that is deemed as harmful to the QLC community in the real world, fails to meet our standards of inclusion, or otherwise alienates members based on real world beliefs and principles will not be tolerated. Keep it clean.'}</p>

			<h4 id={'mandate-of-intention'}>
				{'Mandate of Intention'}
			</h4>

			<p>{'Members of the QLC should, unless they have reasonable doubt, assume good intent on behalf of other citizens and sentient beings. [+OORP] See section 1.2.5.'}</p>

			<h4 id={'mandate-of-peace'}>
				{'Mandate of Peace'}
			</h4>

			<p>{'Members of the QLC should never present themselves as hostile, even after a combat situation or confrontation. Even if an individual should force you to regenerate in the aftermath of a conflict, maintain a diplomatic stance unless their behavior falls under definitions laid forth in 1.2.6. The nature of The Organization is such that we have no direct affiliations or enmities and will not commit to any such association except in the event of grave circumstances as outlined in 1.2.5.A.'}</p>

			<p>{'Exceptions to the Mandate of Peace will be made clear by leadership of The Organization. Most commonly, QLC will be aligned with any organization that engages in moral activities that promote peace, trade, and commerce. We will take a stance opposed to individuals and entities that are quite literally out to do evil, although there may be occasional situations where we will also be aligned.'}</p>

			<h4 id={'mandate-of-engagement'}>
				{'Mandate of Engagement'}
			</h4>

			<p>{'The only context in which a member of the QLC should openly engage in combat, is if it is part of a contract that the member has accepted, in the context of an open declaration of War, in defense of oneself, members of The Organization, or civilians under attack from bad actors, or in justified retribution.'}</p>

			<p>{'War: In the event that any entity declares war on, or has war declared upon by the QLC, members are expected to attack the enemy where victory is a reasonable outcome. We maintain that our objective is peace and any wartime attacks carried out by QLC will be expressly with the goal of forcing our opponent to the negotiating table. As such, we will not attack civilian targets, medical targets, non-combatant targets, supply lines that carry critical sustenance such as water or medicine. Any attack on these categories of enemy entities will constitute a WAR CRIME. Military targets should be exterminated with extreme prejudice except in the event of a true surrender in which case QLC should strive to provide all and any form of aid. If there is no surrender, or the “surrender” is a ruse, members of the QLC should take a Scorched Earth approach to continued combat.'}</p>

			<p>{'Protection: In the event that a member is attacked or witnesses an unlawful or amoral attack on an individual who is clearly and identifiably a peaceful citizen, members are authorized to use armed force to end the fighting.'}</p>

			<p>{'[OORP] Griefing: Grief griefers. The Organization will remunerate you for this in terms of aUEC for weapons, armor, and ship insurance within the financial capabilities of The Organization.'}</p>

			<h4 id={'mandate-of-aid'}>
				{'Mandate of Aid'}
			</h4>

			<p>{'Members of the QLC are expected to provide medical aid when and where possible to any sentient being, regardless of who or what they are. It is expected that the burden of aid falls to the member who is closest to the situation and most able to provide medical aid. This mandate exists not only to establish the moral positions of the QLC, but also establish critical reliability and potentially create or improve business opportunities.'}</p>
